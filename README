# Jasper Reports

Repository for storing Jasper reports.

* The first level of the directory structure is the application.
* Below this, each report exists in its own folder. These are the "shared" reports - available for all clients.
* Also on the second level is an `images` directory. This holds all client logos etc.
* On the same level are `client` directories (named for the client). These have client-specific copies of reports in them.

illustration of directory structure:

    jasper_reports
    ├── nspack
    │   ├── images
    │   ├── report_one
    │   ├── report_two
    │   ├── the_1st_client
    │   │   └── report_two
    │   └── the_2nd_client
    └── pack_materials
        ├── images
        ├── report_one
        └── the_1st_client

In this example, the applications are `nspack` and `pack_materials`. The `1st client` has a specific version of `report_two`, while the `2nd client` and any other clients will use the shared version of `report_two`.
